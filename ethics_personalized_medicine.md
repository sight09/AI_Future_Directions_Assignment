# Ethics in Personalized Medicine

Author: Amanuel Alemu Zewdu

AI models in personalized medicine using datasets such as TCGA carry risks of bias, particularly underrepresentation of
certain ethnic or socioeconomic groups. Such biases may lead to inaccurate treatment recommendations and
unintended health disparities. To mitigate this, it is essential to include diverse patient populations in
training datasets, apply fairness-aware algorithms, and conduct continual audits for algorithmic bias.

Furthermore, transparency and explainable AI methods can help clinicians understand model recommendations
and maintain accountability. Ethical data governance and patient privacy protection (e.g., HIPAA compliance)
must be enforced throughout the AI lifecycle. Finally, human oversight is crucial to ensure AI acts as a
supportive tool rather than a replacement for medical expertise.
